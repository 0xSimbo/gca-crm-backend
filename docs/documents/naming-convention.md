The folder structure should look like the following
required_doc_name.pdf
required_doc_name_annotations.txt
misc_doc_name.pdf
misc_doc_name_rationale.txt
misc_doc_name_annotations.txt
encryption_key.txt (only for encrypted versions)
extra_thoughts.txt
deferments.txt
All required files are prefixed with ‘required’. All miscellaneous files are prefixed with ‘misc’ and must have an accompanying rationale.txt file that states why this miscellaneous document was required in the report.  
Each document, both miscellaneous and required, must also be accompanied by a <(required|misc)\_doc_name_annotations.txt> file that describes the thought process and information the GCA used from the <(required|misc)\_doc_name.pdf> file.
encryption_Key.txt will include a public key to master key mapping where GCA’s and veto council agents can find the key they need to decrypt.  
The extra_thoughts.txt should be used by GCA’s to place any information that is relevant, but falls outside the scope of the individual files.
The deferments.txt file should include all deferments (if any) that were made during the lifetime of the farm’s application.
